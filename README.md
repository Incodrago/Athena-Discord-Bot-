# Athena-Discord-Bot-

The code of my own Discord bot, Athena! Feel free to use it.
For now, the bot is only available in French, but I'm planning on translating it in english.
You'll need to install node.js on your computer if you want to use this bot. You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/ 
Feel free to look up for tutorials on how to make a discord bot using discord.js for further information.
This bot has been made in Javascript and uses the discord.js librairy. You can join the official Discord.js's discord server here: https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9

If you want to use this bot you'll have to have a reasonable amount of knowledge about setting up a bot, javascript, and Discord.js. Don't expect a tutorial on how to install it for now, because I'm only using this repository in order to understand how to use GitHub in more "formal"/"official" projects.
